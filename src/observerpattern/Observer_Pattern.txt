this pattern has one to many relationship.
when subject updates, it sends notification to all observers.
Subject as an arraylist to keep track of all observers. one its updated, it will call update() for each observers.
Each observers has it's own impletmentation of update().
Sub not aware of any thing how ob will update their info, Sub just send all info to them.

I made some changes in "withjavaapi":
observers can track subjects its follows(add list of subjects as field);
observers can remove them self from a certain subjects(add a remove() method in observer);
observers can be initiated without subjects(by no-arg constructor)
observers can register themselves to subjects at any time (by provide registor(Observable) );
add a layer of abstract MyOberver class to avoid any duplicate code.
