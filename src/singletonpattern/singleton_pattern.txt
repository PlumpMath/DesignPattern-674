The Singleton Pattern is a pattern that ensures that there is only ever one single instance of a class,
and provide a globle access point to it.

1.use private constructor
2. use a getInstance() to return this class instance; only method inside this class can call private method (
private constructor)
3. thread safe
3.1 use this way instance will be created once class is loaded in JVM
private static Singleton uniqueInstance = new Singleton();
3.2 use synchronized key word
