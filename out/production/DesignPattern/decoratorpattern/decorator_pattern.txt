The decorator pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

So the decorator wrap the component class. the decorator also extends from component class so they can be
treated the same way. decorator has the component class and add its feature on top of that.

Java.io.*   uses this pattern.
